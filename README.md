Generic Libraries for android projects :)

Async task folder manages calls to urls using some built in classes. With AsyncGetBase you can do get requests, whereas with AsyncTaskBase you can do post, put, patch or delete

Utiles folder manages some android widget functionalities and some common use functions when needed. 

BaseActivity and BaseFragment are to be inherited in all your activivties and fragments so you can access their cool functions.

iF you want to correct any of this you are invited to request the pull and let me know what did I do wrong
